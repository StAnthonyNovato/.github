# ⛪️ St. Anthony of Padua Church – Novato, CA

> *“God’s love is open source - Read the Bible!”*

Welcome to the official GitHub of **St. Anthony of Padua Catholic Church** – home to spiritual growth, community-building, and occasionally chaotic youth ministry coding experiments.

This is where our **church tech stack** lives: websites, tools, and whatever else we dream up (usually at 11PM, with diet coke).

## 🚀 What's This All About?

We’re not your average church developers (because… we’re not average anything).

This GitHub supports:
- 💻 **SAY – St. Anthony Youth**: Our high school ministry and confirmation program
- 🛐 **Mass Tools**: Slides, music lineups, lector scripts, and ministry schedules
- 🧠 **Faith Formation Resources**: We write our own content when nothing online hits quite right

## 🧡 Ministry, But Make It Digital

We believe that tech is just another language for **serving others**. Whether it’s a well-placed button or a clean RSVP form, we want every line of code to make someone’s life easier, holier, or at least mildly less confusing.

## ⚡ Church Tech Manifesto

- Church websites shouldn't look like it's 2004
- Teens deserve clean UX too
- Jesus used parables. We use HTML.
- “Let all that you do be done in love.” (1 Cor 16:14) — even the YAML files
